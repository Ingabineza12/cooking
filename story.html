                        This is not about how great a cook I am, or how wonderful my life is overseas. I moved to Sydney for love and companionship  <br>(I think the word 'marriage ' is overrated ). But if you are taking time to read this, <br> I hope you take away something to chew on thoughtfully and pass it on to your children, family, friends or anyone you think could benefit from it.
