              <p>Kitchen Stories founders Mengting and Verena first met as business students. And while they discovered a shared passion for great food, they approached cooking from completely different angles.  <br> One, an experienced hobby chef, the other, a cooking novice, they took inspiration from their differing food experiences and moved to Berlin with an idea. <br> From there, they brought the world of cooking to a new platform and generated the first video-based, user-friendly, and design-oriented cooking app.

                At the beginning of 2014, Mengting and Verena launched Kitchen Stories in Apple’s App Store. The emotional videos and high-quality step-by-step photos struck a chord with their growing user base, who soon realized that the app’s slogan, “anyone can cook,” isn’t just rhetoric. <br> Apple recognized the app for its high-end design, delicious content, and its usability, and Kitchen Stories soon topped its food category in over 150 countries.
                
                Their success story continued with prestigious awards, such as the Apple App Store’s Best of 2015 and the Google Play Design Award 2016, and a growing team in a new office in Berlin’s vibrant center.<br> Today, Kitchen Stories is available on a number of supported platforms. <br> It offers a rich variety of beautiful recipes, practical kitchen tips, and informative food articles. Kitchen Stories enables food lovers all over the world to connect. It is a brand for everyone and for everyday life.

                This is not about how great a cook I am, or how wonderful my life is overseas. I moved to Sydney for love and companionship  <br>(I think the word 'marriage ' is overrated ). But if you are taking time to read this, <br> I hope you take away something to chew on thoughtfully and pass it on to your children, family, friends or anyone you think could benefit from it.
